## Array
> An Array is a linear collection of elements,  
where the elements can be accessed via indices,  
which are usually integers used to compute offsets





## Recursion
> Any function which calls itself is called recursive.<br>
 A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.<br>
 It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates.<br>
 Each time the function call itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem.<br>
 It terminates when a base case is reached.<br>
 Each recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame (i.e. Memory).<br>
 Solution to some problems are easier to formulate recursively.<br>

Why recursion?
>  Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to write than iterative code. <br>
