### Repository meant for understanding and practice the use of various data structures and algorithms used in programming.

- [Array](#array)
- [Recursion](#recursion)
- [Linked List](#linked list)

## Array
> An Array is a linear collection of elements,  
where the elements can be accessed via indices,  
which are usually integers used to compute offsets





## Recursion
> Any function which calls itself is called recursive.<br>
 A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem.<br>
 It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates.<br>
 Each time the function call itself with a slightly simpler version of the original problem.<br>
 It terminates when a base case is reached.<br>
 Each recursive call requires extra space on the stack frame (i.e. Memory).<br>
 Solution to some problems are easier to formulate recursively.<br>

#### Why recursion?
>  Recursive code is generally shorter and easier to write than iterative code. <br>


## Linked List
> What is a linked List? <br>
> Linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data. <br>
> Linked List has the following properties <br>
>  Successive elements are connected by pointers <br>
>  Last element points to NULL <br>
> It can grow or shrink size during execution of a program <br>
>  It can be made just as long as required <br>
> It does not waste memory space <br>



What is node? <br>
> When we talk about storing list of information, each information set is a node which also plays a role of connection point in the list. <br>





#### Arrays <br>
> Single block of memory with partitions <br>


#### Linked list <br>
> Multiple blocks of memory linked to each other <br>




Limitations in arrays: <br>

 > Fixed size <br>
> Contiguous block of memory <br>
> Inserting or deleting is costly <br>




#### Properties of Linked List: <br>
> Size can be modified <br>
>Non-contiguous memory <br>
> Insertion and deletion at any point is easier <br>
